## 🎶 DAWZY
**A new paradigm for music creation**

DAWZY is an AI-powered music assistant that connects to your DAW and brings your creative ideas to life, whether you speak them, type them, or hum them. From melody sketching to full track manipulation, DAWZY blends intelligent conversation with powerful DAW control to help anyone create the music they hear in their head.

### 💡Built at Berkeley's AI Hackathon 2025

### 🛠️ Built With
- OpenAI API: Chat + voice-to-voice conversation

- Claude AI: DAW scripting logic

- Beatoven.ai: AI music generation from prompts

- Python (Flask): Backend server and DAW control

- React + Tailwind: Frontend chat UI and audio interface

- python-reapy: Live control over Reaper DAW

- Web Audio API: Recording and playback in-browser

### 🎧 Why It Matters
Making music is powerful, but modern DAWs can be intimidating. Many people never produce the melodies they imagine because the tools are complex, expensive, or inaccessible. DAWZY removes that barrier.

Whether you’re a beginner with a melody in your head or a seasoned artist trying to iterate faster, DAWZY helps you move from idea to reality, effortlessly.

### 🧠 What It Does
##### DAWZY is your AI collaborator in the studio.

- 🗣 Voice-to-Voice Chat: Talk to DAWZY like you would a co-producer. It listens, responds, and acts.

- 🎵 Humming-to-MIDI: Hum a tune. DAWZY converts it into MIDI and plays it back with an instrument of your choice.

- 📝 Prompt-Based Music Generation: Describe what you want - “lofi chill beat with piano” - and DAWZY builds it using Beatoven.

- 🎚 DAW Scripting via Language: Say “Add reverb to track 2” or “Increase the bass” — DAWZY generates scripts to modify your DAW.

- 🧠 Session Memory: DAWZY remembers context from your conversation and your DAW.
